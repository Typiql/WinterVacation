The software engineers had created a design using Figma , which was then converted into a responsive HTML/CSS layout.
We had used "Swiper" and "Leaflet" Javascript libraries to create a map and a slider. The Data engineering team
had gathered data from ski resorts across the US which allowed us to create a database of ski resorts with their respective locations and amenities.
